The heart symbolizes a pure love for God and neighbor. The liver symbolizes the removal of sin from one's life (the liver removes toxins from the body). The gall symbolizes the suffering of self-denial and the healthful effects on the soul of that suffering (since gall is bitter, but was used as a medicine in ancient times).

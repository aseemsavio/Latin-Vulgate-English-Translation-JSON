The Romans and Greeks of that time knew that the world was a sphere. The word ‘terram’ in this context refers to ‘the earth,’ not merely to ‘the land.’ The word ‘pelagus’ refers to the open ocean, not merely to the Mediterranean or the coastal waters. There is no reference here to walking or traveling by foot; the text does not say that he wanted to make the sea passable on foot. It does not say that.\n The usual translation of this verse, that he wanted, in effect, to sail on land and walk on water applies to the eschatological meaning of the text: After conquering the king of the South and entering the great Sanctuary of the Faith, the Antichrist will be so elated that he will think to accomplish things beyond mere human ability, such will be the elation of his mind.\n On the other hand, in this more literal translation of the text, the historical person Antiochus did not think to sail on land or walk on water. The words ‘foot’ or ‘walk’ are not in the verse. Rather, he thought to circumnavigate the globe. The scholars of that time period did, in fact, know that the earth was a globe, and they could predict the dates of solar and lunar eclipses, and lunar phases."

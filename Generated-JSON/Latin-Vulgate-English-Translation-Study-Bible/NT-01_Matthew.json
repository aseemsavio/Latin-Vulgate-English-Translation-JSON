They claim that Jesus was only referring to getting a camel through that small gateway, when he expressed how hard it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God. But even though that gateway is narrow, it is not too difficult to get a camel through it. Perhaps it happened on a near daily basis. If this was the meaning of the saying, then it would not seem too difficult for the wealthy to enter heaven, and the disciples would be foolish to say 'Then who will be able to be saved?' And again, if so, then Jesus would not have said that it was impossible for men. So the saying has another meaning. It is a literal expression of the miraculous power of God. For a wealthy person to be saved, apart from the infinite mercy of God is impossible, nearly as impossible as literally passing a camel through the eye of a needle. But both acts can be done by the power of God."

The length of this time is approximately an hour. Although the word ‘evening’ is used very broadly today, it specifically refers to that period of time between sunset and darkness, or, as in this case, between darkness and sunrise. So the two Marys set out at evening, that is, at first light in the morning, but before sunrise. The translation avoids this confusion of terms by using morning, instead of evening.\n Notice that Matthew, after the Crucifixion, begins to count Sunday, the day of the Resurrection, as the Sabbath. Whereas, elsewhere in his Gospel, he counts Saturday as the Sabbath. He also states that this day is the first (Christian) Sabbath."

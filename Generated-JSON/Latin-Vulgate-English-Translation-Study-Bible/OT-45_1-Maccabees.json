                "notes": "Despite the advantage of having foiled the ambush, the men on Jonathan’s side fled during combat. The phrase “princeps militiæ exercitus” has the singular ‘princeps,’ so it refers only to Judas, not also to Mattathias. The last two words each could be taken to refer to the army, but in that case the phrase would be redundant. The last word, ‘exercitus,’ could also be a participle. In other words, Judas was the leader of military training, not the leader of the whole army. This makes more sense because, if Judas and Mattathias were the two leaders of the army, then everyone would not have fled. But if Mattathias were merely a soldier, and Judas was in charge of training soldiers, the others could have fled despite their example."

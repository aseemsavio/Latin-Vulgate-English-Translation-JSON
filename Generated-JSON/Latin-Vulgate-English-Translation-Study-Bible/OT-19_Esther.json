In some arid lands, where there are not many trees to use as fuel for fires, people use dried animal dung to burn for their fires. Esther took ashes from such a fire and put them on her head.

The word “vir” has a generally positive connotation, not unlike the word “gentleman.” But, in the next verse, the author has Haman use the word “homo,” meaning merely “man,” because Haman is referring to himself. The author puts the less complementary word in Haman’s mouth to show that Haman is not worthy to be called “vir.” Haman is not a gentleman, but merely a man."

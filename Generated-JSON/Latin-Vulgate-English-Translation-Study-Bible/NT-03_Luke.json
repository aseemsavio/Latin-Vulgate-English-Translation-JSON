                "notes": "The second first Sabbath is the first Sabbath after the first Sabbath of Passover. The first Sabbath of Passover is used as a starting point for counting the seven weeks (and seven Sabbaths) until the Feast of Weeks. The day after the first Sabbath of Passover is day one in that count. (The ancients did not use the concept of zero in counting, but in our way of thinking, the first Sabbath of Passover is zero.) So the first week of the seven weeks ends with the first Sabbath of the seven Sabbaths on day 7. This is the first Sabbath in the count of seven Sabbaths to the Feast of Weeks (which is held on the day after that 7th Sabbath, i.e. the fiftieth day, or Pentecost). So there are two first Sabbaths: the first Sabbath during Passover (the day used to mark the start of the counting toward the Feast of Weeks, which is also called Pentecost) and the first Sabbath after Passover, which is the second first Sabbath.\n This interpretation is proved correct by the interaction between the Pharisees, the disciples, and Jesus. It was against the Law to eat from the standing ripe grain on the first Sabbath during Passover, because not until the next day were the first fruits of the ripe grain offered to God. But on the second first Sabbath it was lawful to eat from the standing ripe grain, because the first fruits had been offered the previous Sunday. The Pharisees object based on an over-extension of the Law against working on the Sabbath, but Luke points out that they had no ground to stand on under the Law since it was the second first Sabbath."

Some might argue that the centurion lacked true faith, and was merely remarking on Jesus’ innocence, that he was just, but not the Son of God. But the Romans believed in gods and sons of gods, so the centurion had a basic understanding that God can have a Son. And a Roman soldier stationed in Judea would certainly be aware of the controversies among the inhabitants. So he knew that many believed in Jesus as the Son of God, and he also knew that this was the controversy over which he was killed. Then, knowing all this, upon seeing the very act of Christ dying for our salvation, which effects the salvation of all, his comment was not merely that Jesus was innocent. For Christ was only innocent of the charges, if He is the Son of God and the Just One. If Jesus were merely a just man, or a son of God as all men are sons of God, then He would not be innocent. Therefore, the Soldier was saying that this man Jesus was truly the Son of God, the Just One."

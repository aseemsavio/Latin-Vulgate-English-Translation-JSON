Subtracting 1.5 years gives us 6.5 years: the length of time from the completion of the Sanctuary (at which time the rebuilt Temple was consecrated to God and the count of the years began) to the completion of the other buildings related to the Sanctuary. Then 40 more years are counted until Christ cleansed the temple by driving out the buyers and sellers.\n Since Jesus was referring to his body as a temple, of which the temple building is merely a symbol, this passage also refers symbolically to the length of time since the Immaculate Conception. This was now the 46th Passover since the Immaculate Conception, when God began to build the temple of Christ’s body by first building the temple of Mary’s body, in which God dwelt for 9 months (in the womb)."

As a blind man, he would have been considered to be blind as a punishment for sin, and would therefore be excluded from being taught by the Jewish priests. So he would not have learned much Hebrew. Being excluded, to some extent, from Jewish society, he may have favored Latin as his spoken language. His other quoted words also sound very natural in Latin."

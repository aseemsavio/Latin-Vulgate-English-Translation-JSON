The phrase “in cornu filio olei” is correctly translated in the original Douai version, and also in the Wycliffe translation: “in the horn in the son of oil”. At first glace, this translation might not seem to make sense. But the word ‘horn’ was used to describe an area of land (perhaps irregularly shaped) that would be at the extremity of a larger parcel of land. It might be a raised area, since higher ground is better for growing plants (in that it drains well and warms quickly). This vineyard belonged to the father’s brother’s son, so it would have been divided to him from out of a larger parcel. So which part of the larger area of land was he given? It was a choice area, which was termed ‘the son of oil,’ in other words, the most productive part of the vineyard."

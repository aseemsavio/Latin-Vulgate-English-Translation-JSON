The word impudicitia can refer to serious sexual immorality in general, but it often is used to refer to homosexuality. Since the other words in this list refer more generally to sexual immorality, this word must refer to the more specific sin of homosexuality (otherwise the word would be redundant and unnecessary to the sentence). Notice the progression in this list of offenses: first inner sexual sins, then fornication, then a more serious type of fornication, homosexuality."

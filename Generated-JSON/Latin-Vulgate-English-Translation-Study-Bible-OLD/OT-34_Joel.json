In verse 3:2, God complains ‘for they have scattered them among the nations and have divided my land.’ This verse also references the valley of Jehoshaphat. So, verse 14 gives us a play on words. They have scattered and divided, so now they will be divided into pieces. Also, ‘iuxta’ in this verse does not mean ‘near.’ It means ‘according to’ or ‘accordingly’ or ‘fittingly.’ In other words, they are cut to pieces according to the way that they have treated God’s people, scattering them and dividing their land."

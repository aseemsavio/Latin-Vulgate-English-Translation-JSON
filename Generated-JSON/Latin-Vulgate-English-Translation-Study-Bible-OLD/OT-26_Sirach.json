Sweet gum is the closest translation which preserves the figurative meaning of the text and also is easily understandable in English. Challoner translates ‘gutta’ (lit. a droplet) as aloe. The phrase ‘Libanus non incisus’ refers to cedar wood from Lebanon (see previous verse). The phrase ‘non incisus’ means uncut, but certainly it is not an uncut tree; rather, it is an expression referring to the excellence of the cedar wood."

This passage is not saying that men's sins are better than women's sins. Rather, it is advice as to how to advise and govern a young unmarried daughter. If she hangs around older women, they might think to 'help' her by giving her advice about men which is not fitting to someone who is young and unmarried, so instead of benefiting her, they would lead her into confusion and disgrace. In other words, hanging around older married women might corrupt your virgin unmarried daughter, since they might talk about men in a licentious manner."

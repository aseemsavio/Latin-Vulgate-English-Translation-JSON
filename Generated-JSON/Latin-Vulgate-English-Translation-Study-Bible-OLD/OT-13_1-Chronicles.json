The phrasing that relates Zerubbabel to Pedaiah is somewhat unusual; instead of the more common ‘genuit’ (begot or conceived) used in the passages saying that Shealtiel conceived Zerubbabel, here the figurative phrase is used meaning ‘to rise up from’ (orti sunt). When a man died without a male heir, the custom among the Jews was for his brother to take the deceased man’s wife and conceive children on behalf of his brother. Thus it may be that Zerubbabel and Shimei were both conceived by Shealtiel, because Pedaiah had died without any son. Then this passage attributes Zerubbabel and Shimei to Pedaiah, as having risen up from him, but they actually had Shealtiel as their biological father."

At death, the body is buried in a grave, the soul (hopefully) goes to heaven, and the breath of life merely ceases to exist. Thus, spiritus is not another way of referring to the soul, nor is it a separated second soul-like substance, but merely the condition of a body which is alive and which obviously ceases at death. In the modern view, the human person is body and soul. We take for granted the understanding that during life the body has life and at death that bodily life ceases.\nSome have claimed that the human person is tripartite (consisting of three parts) based on a misunderstanding of passages in Scripture that refer to spirit as well as soul. Some passages have been misunderstood because they say that man’s spirit ceases to exist when he dies. Such passages are correctly stating that the breath of life (spiritus) ceases to exist upon death; but these passages are not denying the immortality of the soul (animae)."

This would be very unusual in past centuries, but fits the modern political situation, which is nevertheless unfortunate and offensive to God, wherein women take roles of leadership in society.

In the case of the leader who arrives after the additional sixty-two weeks of years, again this cannot be Christ himself (since there is still one more week of years to be completed), but again a Christ-like leader (this time it refers to the king of the South, as well as the Pope). Some translations give the weaker and more ambiguous translation of “Anointed one.”\n Interestingly, some Christians have misinterpreted the Christum ducem who arrives seven weeks of years after the rebuilding of Jerusalem (that is, after the founding of the State of Israel,) to mean that Christ himself would arrive at this early date (in the late 1990’s A.D.).

Thus, the abomination of desolation is a perverse imitation of the Eucharist and the Mass, a false Eucharist, which continues for about three and one half years, even until the end of the Passion and Crucifixion of the Church and the end of the reign of sin on earth."

But the phrase a daughter among women is an unusual twist on the more common expression of a woman among women. From the context and from the expression, this phrase would still seem somewhat complementary. She is an exemplary woman – but so young as to be called a daughter rather than a woman. An exemplary young woman, and perhaps the meaning is also that she is too young for the task she has been given. In any case, she fails at her unenviable task and she does not remain with him."

RSV: “ships of Kittim,” NIV: “Ships of the western coastlands,” NKJV: “ships from Cyprus,” NIRV: “Roman ships,” NLT: “warships from western coastlands.” The Bible has been translated into Latin since the earliest days of the Church, so this Latin text (Trieres, et Romani) may be based on some ancient manuscripts, in Hebrew or Greek, which are not now extant.\n The Trieres is a type of warship used by the ancient Greeks. But in Daniel, Greece symbolizes democracy, since that is where democracy first began. So, giving the text a modern interpretation, these warships are from an area which still, at that time in the future, practices some form of democracy. But, though the ships are Greek ships, the crew is Roman, which in the modern context would refer to Roman Catholics (or to Christians in general during a future time when all Christians are united in one Church). This interpretation explains why the Antichrist is indignant against Christianity after his defeat and why he sets out to destroy the Faith about halfway through his reign. Daniel 9:27 refers to this time of half a week of years.\n The Antichrist then consults the adversaries of the Christians, those who have abandoned the Christian faith."

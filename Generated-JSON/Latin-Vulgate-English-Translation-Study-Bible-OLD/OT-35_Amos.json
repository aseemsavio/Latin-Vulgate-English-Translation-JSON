                "notes": "In the Latin, you can see that ‘suum’ refers to Edom, but ‘ejus’ refers to his brother. This would not be apparent in English unless ‘ejus’ is translated loosely as ‘his brother,’ rather than as merely ‘his.’\n Literally, ‘tenuerit ultra furorem suum’ is ‘he has kept beyond his anger.’ But in this context it refers to going beyond the limits of one’s anger. Notice how this plays into the next verse, ‘usque in finem.’ He goes beyond the limits of his anger and he holds onto his anger until the limit."
